- 👋 Hi, I’m @luskos, my real name is Lyudmil. Believe me I am not Russian, i've met Ukrainian few weeks ago that stated that this name isn't used for boys up north... Anyway, it's nice to know that luskos, roughly translates as Humane, or Human from the Polish word "ludzkość".
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming obviously, I love coding, and fiction novel writing is a passion. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, 3d Modeling, Neural Networks, Image processing, 3d manipulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other people. I know a little bit of everything about everything, and have no problem of finding what's missing and learn that
- too!
