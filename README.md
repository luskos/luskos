- 👋 Hi, I’m @luskos, call me L.
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming obviously, I love coding, and fiction novel writing is a passion. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, 3d Modeling, Neural Networks, Image processing, 3d manipulation. I am somewhat proficient at making pixel art.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other people. I know a little bit of everything about everything, and have no problem of finding what's missing and learn that too!
