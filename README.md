- 👋 Hi, I’m @luskos, my real name is Lyudmil. Believe me I am not Russian, i've met Ukrainian few weeks ago that stated that this name isn't used for boys up north... Anyway, it's nice to know that luskos, roughly translates as Humane, or Human from the Polish word "ludzkość".
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming obviously, I love writing code, and fiction novels. Sadly there's AI for this today that learns thousand times faster, soon our only job as humans will be to check the learning feed of the AI for errors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, 3d Modeling, Neural Networks, Image processing, 3d manipulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything will do, I know a little bit of everything about everything, and has no problem to find what's missing and learn
- too!
