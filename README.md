- 👋 Hi, I’m @luskos, my real name is Lyudmil. Believe me I am not Russian, i've met Ukrainian few weeks ago that stated that this name isn't used for boys up north... Anyway, it's nice to know that luskos, roughly translates as Humane, or Human from the Polish word "ludzkość".
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming obviously, I love coding, and fiction novel writing is a passion. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, 3d Modeling, Neural Networks, Image processing, 3d manipulation. I am somewhat proficient at making pixel art.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other people. I know a little bit of everything about everything, and have no problem of finding what's missing and learn that
- too!

- Currently devloping Data Processing library - Making Data Containers, Archive Copies, Data Compression, Muxing, Shuffling, etc.
- Paralel to that I am dealing with my own propreitary tool P³ (Pixel Paint Pro), Image and 3d model processor. The ultimate goal is to make the making of 2d sprite sheets out of 3d model animations, Diablo II style. As technology wasn't advanced enough if you look closer to that game, you realize that all the sprites are actually prerendered and animated models that are only spritesheeted, because the CPU power of the machines of this era wasn't so great and as always Blizzard strive to get at lest 95%+ of the people interested in their product by making sure the game will be interesting and run on potato powered calculator!
